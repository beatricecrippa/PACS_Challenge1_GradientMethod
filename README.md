# PACS_Challenge1_GradientMethod
A gradient method for the minimization of a multivariate function

Everything is in the main.cpp

- Struct data: it contains all the parameters for the gradient method with Armijo Rule
- norm_L2: function to compute the norm
- gradient_method_Armijo: function that computes the minimum with Armijo Rule
- gradient_method_HeavyBall: function that computes the minimum with Heavy ball Rule
- main: the main section
